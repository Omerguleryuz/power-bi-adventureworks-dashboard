## AdventureWorks Power BI Dashboard

This project showcases an interactive Power BI dashboard created using the AdventureWorks dataset. The dashboard visualizes key business metrics like sales performance and customer insights. 

Overview:
Sales Performance: This section highlights sales trends over time and regional sales breakdown. Users can explore data on revenue trending, demand for product categories and monthly targets and actual performances.
Customer Insights: This area focuses on customer segmentation, sales by income groups, and our top customers. It helps to understand customer behavior and identify profitable customer segments.

This project helped me improve my skills in data modeling, DAX, interactive visualizations, and the Power Query Editor, enabling me to create an insightful and interactive dashboard that can be used for data-driven decision-making.
